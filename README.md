# Starfield Community Patch

The Starfield Community Patch (SCP) project is a collective effort by mod
authors and the wider player community of Starfield to fix bugs, errors and
other inconsistencies present in the game. This includes tweaks, typos and
other changes that may have been missed (or not yet released) by the
developers. The overall goal is to improve the vanilla experience for allplayers.
